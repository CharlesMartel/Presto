Presto
======

Presto is a .NET application that facilitates the easy creation of clustered applications in C# or VisualBasic

Presto provides the ability to send individual functions into a cluster of machines to be executed. Presto also
provides pre built clustered data structures and a message passing system for inter-cluster communication.

Check out the Examples folder for an example.

NOTE* Presto is currently pre-beta. While plenty of features are functinal, there is still many more to implement
and stress tests are still very primative. It is not recommended for production use at this time.

Requirements
------------

- .NET v4.0 or later / Mono v2.10 or later
- .NET compiler. Both the MonoDevelop DMCS and Visual Studio compilers are supported.
